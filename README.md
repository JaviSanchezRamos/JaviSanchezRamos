👋 Hi, I’m @JaviSanchezRamos

👀 I’m passionate about programming, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, web development, and multiplatform application development.

🌱 I’m currently studying for a Higher Technician Diploma in Cross-Platform Application Development (DAM) at La Salle Girona, where I work with Java, C++, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.

👥 I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving AI, web and application development, and innovative solutions with real impact.

📫 You can reach me at: javiersanchezramos2003@gmail.com

👨🏻‍💻 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I’m 22 years old and fascinated by how AI can transform industries. When I’m not coding, I enjoy gaming, exploring new tech trends, and staying active at the gym!
